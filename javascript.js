//--Let's get started!

//--We need to establish characters.  4 of them.
var characterOne = 
//--characters have health and default attack power stats.

//--Select a character, and they become "your character".  move remaining characters to "available to be attacked" 

//--selecting a character changes their attack var to '5'.

//--select an enemy and they move to the defender zone.

//--add attack button functionality.

//--attack button does the following: Reduce enemy HP by current player ATK, reduce player HP by enemy ATK, then raise player ATK var by its initial value.

//--if enemy HP = 0, despawn enemy.

//--if attack button is pressed and there are no enemies in defender zone, then zone displays text: "Nobody home"

//--add reset button
